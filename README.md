        The protagonist starts off in a room, feels as if he/she were knocked out. The atmosphere starts creepy as the protagonist has no understanding of where he/she is at the moment. The protagonist wonders around looking for clues of his memories and a way out. Eventually the protagonist finds a girl, she explains to the protagonist what he/she should do without telling the protagonist the leading events up to the present time.

  	    In our sense of format we designed our levels as rooms. Each room has a special characteristic. As the protagonist goes deeper and deeper into these chambers of secrets the more the story is developed. By using the WASD keys the character is allowed to move up, down, right, and left. Using these movements and going into black squares that seem ominous you can move on to new rooms. At each new door there is a new puzzle that slowly connects to come with an end result of the character remembering who he is. There are also many other characters telling the character hints about where to go and how to get out, but these side characters are only in his head. However, the character may come out to what seems like a happy ending, he is not safe in this abandoned mansion. He slowly feels something creeping up on him following him everywhere he goes. Lastly, the anonymous figure crawls up on the main character to take him out of his misery.
